Overview

This project aims to automate the loan approval process using machine learning, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy in credit underwriting. By analyzing applicant demographic, financial, and loan-related attributes, the model predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains over 10,000 observations with features including:

Applicant demographics (age, gender, employment status, etc.)

Financial history (income, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, etc.)

Loan attributes (loan amount, term, interest rate, etc.)

Target variable: Loan approval status (approved/rejected)

Data Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for modeling, the following steps are performed:

Handling Missing Values: Imputation using mean, median, or mode.

Outlier Detection: Capping extreme values based on statistical thresholds.

Feature Encoding: Converting categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Feature Scaling: Applying min-max or z-score normalization.

Class Balancing: Addressing class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE.

Train-Test Split: Dividing data into training and test sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted to understand data distributions and relationships:

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, density plots, and descriptive statistics.

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Correlation matrix, scatter plots, PCA.

Target Variable Analysis: Understanding approval vs. rejection patterns.

Machine Learning Models

Multiple supervised learning models are trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective baseline model.

Random Forest: An ensemble model capturing feature interactions.

XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting model optimized for tabular data.

Model Evaluation

Performance is assessed using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall Curve

Confusion Matrix for error analysis

Feature Importance for interpretability

Bias & Fairness Consideration

Evaluating model fairness across demographic groups.

Mitigating bias using fairness-aware techniques.

Deployment

Future work includes deploying the trained model as an API using Flask or FastAPI for integration into loan processing systems.
